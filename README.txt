So, next actions: 


* Work out how to use shader presets and where all the games are 
* Test the 'we are going to pause you now' version of gaming 
* Test Mario Kart 64 
* Tests! More tests for the cadence monitoring: see if you can replicate the data for sudden speed ups and slow downs. 
* Look into Remote Play for PS4 and things like https://github.com/daeken/ShockEmu  
* a 'clutch' system so you can do menu screens better 
* GUI 
* Make this into an actual README file with instructions 
* Work out how to use the emulator client and fix all the little problems 
* Investigate other games
* Check out a dynamo and see how that would work.
